# GitHub Action Local Executor

GitHub Action Local Executor , aka `gale`, is a customisable Github Action environment that can be run locally. 
The goal of this project is to combine the features of the Dagger and Github Actions together to create a local 
environment that can be used to run Github Actions as if they were running on Github.

**Warning**: This project is still in early development and is not ready for production use.
