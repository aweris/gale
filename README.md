# GitHub Action Local Executor

Welcome to project `gale`!

Project `gale` is a Dagger module that allows you to run GitHub Actions locally or anywhere you can run Dagger as if 
they were running on GitHub.

With `gale`, you can get to enjoy a series of perks:

- **Speedy Execution**: Get your workflows running faster compared to the usual GitHub Action Workflow.

- **Cache Support**: Save time on repetitive tasks with enhanced caching features.

- **Programmable Environment**: Customize your execution environment to your liking, making it more adaptable and extensible.

**Heads up:** We are continually working to enhance `gale`. As it is in active development, you might notice changes in 
commands and APIs over time. Your understanding and support are greatly appreciated!
